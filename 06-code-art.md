(math == art && art == code) by [John Brown](http://twitter.com/thisisjohnbrown)

- Color Palettes: Mathematical principals
- Music: just bits of data (time signature, scale, chord)
- Code art: Make it in JS, share with the world

> Like all great artists, I dropped out of art school... (2 times)

- sin & cos are rotation, and movement, and you can create really cool things out of layering
- Visions of Tomorrows <-- art show. generative art

### Why code art?

1. Learning is more fun w/art
2. Freedom of personal projects
3. New Problems (non-binary)

### Demo #1: Light board
- typical John blowing minds with his examples & WIPs
- vids of him making the light board in progress (show your work)

> Codepen can be your sketchbook

#### Things Learned:
- Bitwise operators
- LED dithering (lookup tables on how LED lights are interpreted by our eyes)

### Demo #2: Glitch Art

- worked w/ [Chris Arth](https://twitter.com/chrisarth)
- opens up jpg in code editor, starts changing some of the numbers, copies and pastes lines around
- [@avatarglitch](https://twitter.com/avatarglitch)

#### Things Learned:
- how JPGs are constructed (for decent-looking generative glitch art)
- how to make animated gifs, buffers

- [PDX Creative Coders](http://blog.codepen.io/2014/11/21/pdx-creative-coders/)

### Demo #3: Plinko

- Digital canvas for generative art
- [Website](http://www.plin.co/)
- [Twitter with Videos](https://twitter.com/plinco)
- Full-screen chrome browser with Canvas, projected
- 99.7% Javascript

#### Things Learned:
- hardware things, software things
- projection mapping

### Homework

Each should take 1-2 hours, just try flexing a new part of your brain:

Options:

1. **Uncontext:** [Link](http://www.uncontext.com/) --publicly accessible web sockets you can connect to -- change overtime according to certain rules and patterns. (Make something with it!)
2. **Codepen:** [Link](http://codepen.io) -- find something visually interesting and play with it
3. **Creative Code Group:** Find one near you! And if you can't find one, start one!
