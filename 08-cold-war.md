This was essentially an amazing themed talk about JS simulations.

- Showed us war simulations in JS -- amazing :)
- Game loop will burn out your CPU -- use RequestAnimationFrame instead
- create scaling factor for physics
- HTML5 canvas -- accepted everywhere except some obscure browsers and IE8
- bitmap displays vs. vector displays

1. Game Loop
2. Request Animation Frame
3. Canvas

*these slides are too epic to take notes on this talk*
