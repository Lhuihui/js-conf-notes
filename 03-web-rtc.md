### Examples using WebRTC:
- Amazon Mayday
- Google Hangouts
- [Appolo](http://github.com/respoke/apollo)
- [PeerCDN](http://peercdn.com)
- [Cubeslam](http://www.cubeslam.com)
- [Speaking Exchange](http://cna.com.br/speakingexchange)
- [Be My Eyes](http://bemyeyes.org)

- WebRTC: two people want to connect and it allows the connection
- Bob & Alice signaling process -- gets mangled

### Respoke
- [Respoke](https://www.respoke.io/): A set of APIs that gives developers communication abilities for their app
- Open source JS libraries
- Features: cross browser support, endpoint discovery (doesn't exist natively in WebRTC), groups, messaging, phone system support

### Get connected
- dump in an include
- use your individualized app ID (container for all your users)
- API token
- call `client.connect` and pass through an endpoint ID

### Demo Time
- showed demos of group chat and video calls

> Happy users are the bigger take away

- **Communication should be a feature, not a product**
- Don't send users away, integrate communication seamlessly into your app
