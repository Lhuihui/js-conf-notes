If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe by [Ashley Williams](http://twitter.com/ag_dubs)

### Abstraction

- **abstraction** factors out details to the level of human understanding -- immaterial to the problem being solved

> "I teach beginners and beginners teach me" -- Ashley

- "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute" -- Abelson and Sussman

- JavaScript is great for expressing the underling concepts of iteration

> "There is no abstract art -- you must always start with something" -- Pablo Picasso

- humans are really good at finding patterns and giving them names (i.e. constellations)
- we need to be careful about this bc patterns become ideologies (i.e. horoscopes)
- bad abstractions are *real* problems

### ES6 Classes

- classes in JS are not blueprints, they're model homes
- JS classes are like objects
- What even is a class? [Simula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula)

> "Teaching is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your understanding is" -- Ashley

> *"Teach concepts not syntax" -- Ashley*

- **The Creative Extension Principle**: We build the abstractions we need when we need them
- don't pre-optimize
- prototypal inheritance: how the apple pie gets made
- abstractions should match the concepts that are supported
- [Pyret](http://www.pyret.org/) <-- people are changing how we program
- consider ontology early and ofren
