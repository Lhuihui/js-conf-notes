Umm... I have to do WHAT to run this code? by [Gord Tanner](http://twitter.com/gordtanner)

- Don't just sent people away to some other document --> leads to frustration, failure, misinformation

> First impressions matter

- the first day of your project on the first day sets the tone for the **perceived quality** of your code
- documentation is extremely important
- with Github, the `README` became the entry point -- front and center
- contributors are a success metric for a healthy project --> be friendly to your contributors


###  Comment your code!

1. comment what your code does <-- this is self documenting
2. why your code is doing that

- Use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)! But hide the fact that you're using it.
