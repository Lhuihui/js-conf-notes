- first create audio `context`
- `destination`: your amplifier -- what you're plugging everything into
- `const context = new AudioContext(); context.destination`
- then make `oscillator`
- oscillator creates a sound wave -- sound is a vibration in the air
- amplitude = how high the beats are and how loud
